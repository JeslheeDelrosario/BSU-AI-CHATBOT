| Grade | Percentage | Remark |
|-------|------------|--------|
| 1.00 | 97-100% | Excellent |
| 1.25 | 94-96% | Very Good |
| 1.50 | 91-93% | Very Good |

| 2.25 | 82-84% | Satisfactory |
| 2.50 | 79-81% | Satisfactory |
| 2.75 | 76-78% | Fair |

    {
      category: 'Grading System',
      question: 'What does a 4.00 (Conditional Passed) grade mean?',
      answer: `A 4.00 grade is given when a student is slightly below the passing criteria but has the potential to pass the course.

Key points:
• The student must consult with the subject teacher to address deficiencies within 2 weeks
• If deficiencies are not resolved within 2 weeks, the grade automatically changes to 5.00 (Failed)
• The 4.00 grade does not appear on the student's permanent record or transcript

This policy encourages students to actively address minor academic deficiencies before failing.`,

      question: 'What is an "Inc." (Incomplete) grade?',
      answer: `An Incomplete (Inc.) is assigned when a student is passing all grading criteria except for missing certain requirements such as projects, assignments, or activities.

Key points:
• Students have a grace period of one (1) year to complete the missing requirements
• If requirements are not completed within one year, the grade automatically becomes 5.00 (Failed)
• If the incomplete grade is in a prerequisite subject, the student cannot enroll in the subsequent subject until the prerequisite is completed`,

      category: 'Grading System',
      question: 'What does "D" (Officially Dropped) mean?',
      answer: `"D" indicates that a student has officially dropped a subject by submitting a formal dropping form, which must be signed by the instructor, dean, and university registrar.

This grade ensures that the student's withdrawal is properly documented and does not affect other academic records adversely.`,

    {
      category: 'Grading System',
      question: 'What does FDA or UD mean?',
      answer: `FDA (Failure Due to Absences) occurs when a student discontinues attending class without informing the instructor, resulting in failure.

UD (Unofficially Dropped) occurs when a student stops attending the class without filing a formal dropping form, which also counts as failure.

These grades highlight the importance of regular attendance and proper communication with instructors.`,
